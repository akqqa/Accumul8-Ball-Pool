# CS4303-P2

Plan:

Start fully on 5th April - gives 4 weeks 2 days ish

First goal: pool simulation game
Requirements:
- balls
- ball collisions
- ball physics (acceleration, impulses etc - try using code from p1) (make sure to make adjustable with lots of parameters)
- player controls (cue ball, rotating cue, draggging for power, releasing to shoot and add impulse to ball)
- Scoring and rounds - balls going into the holes correctly, adding points, keeping track and hbaving to beat round inc ertain number of shots

Second goal: expand rogue like elements
- Random map generation - randomly shaped table with wall collision
- basic powerups - just the 4 active balls
- end of round powerup selection and inventory system to hold powerups

Third goal: expand further
- more powerups, passives and combinations
- bosses maybe

Pre-first week: set up basic pool table and ball objects
First week plan:
- Johan - player controls, moving cue, dragging for power, releasing to impulse the ball
- Joe and alex - work on ball phsyics and collisions


Notes - todo for alex:
- aim lines with wall hits
- proper gravity ball balance
- sound effects not stacking
- more sound effects and music
